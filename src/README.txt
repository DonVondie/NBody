A few to figure out that my code from the fall does not, 
in fact, cut it. The return value in the fall was a 2 x 5
array for planets.txt, whereas, in the present time, the 
requirement is that we supply a 5 x 2 matrix. Tricksy, false
hobbits! That is a good way to sort out the riff raff so I can't
complain. 

Cheers,

Richie
